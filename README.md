Unicorn â€“ Deep Learning-Powered Warnings and Wallet Holds for Crypto Traders

Unicorn is a Deep Learning-powered spending limiter that identifies historic losses and prevents you from repeating them. Centered on the idea that predicting emotions is easier than foreseeing complex markets, Unicorn can be set to either warn you or block your wallet when you reach a point of potential repeat loss.

Rather than simply giving advice to the investor, Unicorn works on the level of the zkSync contracts themselves, using transfer learning to acclimate to the sample size of the investor's individual habits and proceeding to either warn or freeze out the investor when their patterns indicate tilt or a future wrong move. Once the hold on the solidity contract has triggered, the investor must wait a customizable amount of time in order to start trading again. 

Through this, Unicorn's task is fundamentally easier than many stock and crypto exchanges: rather than adapting to the complex market, it adapts to the investor themself. This also makes its growth potential much higher, as an investor's Unicorn grows with them, learning from every success and failure of the individual's trading career.
